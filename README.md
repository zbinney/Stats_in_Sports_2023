# Statistics in Sports Class, Fall 2023

Materials for the Statistics in Sports class for first-year undergrads at Oxford College of Emory University. This course is unique in that it assumes no background in statistics, sports, or sports analytics. It covers:

* An introduction to sports analytics and R for sports analytics
* Basketball analytics
* Football analytics
* Soccer analytics
* Sports business analytics (mini-unit with no lecture or R labs)
* Some other random sessions as part of Oxford's first-year experience (ignore these)

Materials include:
* Syllabus
* Lecture slides
* Practical R labs/"Tutorials", which also include homework assignments.
* Instructions for two other assignments: an article analysis and a group final project using real-world sports data. The final projects were presented in class with experts in each sport listening and providing feedback.
